- The files were installed to '$install_path/'.
- A '$pokemonsay_bin' script was created in '$bin_path/'.

"$HOME/bin" must be in your \$PATH to be able to use pokesay, you can do this by running

  echo 'export PATH=\$HOME/bin:\$PATH' >> \$HOME/.bash_profile

After starting a new terminal session you should have the '$pokemonsay_bin' available in your path.
